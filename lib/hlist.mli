(** The index type [('a,'b,'xs,'ys) idx] says that:

    - It refers to the portion ['a] in ['xs], and
    - If ['a] in ['xs] is replaced with ['b], ['ys] is obtained.

    The [Zero] constructor refers to the first element of a (type-level)
    cons-list. The list is expressed by a polymorphic variant
    [\[`cons of 'hd * 'tl\]], and [Zero] refers to the ['hd] part of a list. The
    type [Zero : ('a, 'b, \[`cons of 'a * 'tl\], \[`cons of 'b * 'tl\]) idx]
    says that the type of the head of list is ['a], and it could be replaced by
    ['b], obtaining the whole list type [\[`cons of 'b * 'tl\]].

    [Succ] is more complex. It takes a lens referring to some portion ['a] in
    ['aa], and makes another lens larger by one value, by nesting it inside
    [\[`cons of 'hd * 'aa\]].
